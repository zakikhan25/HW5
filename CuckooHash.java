/**
 * Cuckoo Hashing Exercise
 *
 * Cuckoo hashing is a scheme for resolving hash collisions of keys in 
 * a hashmap that maintains a worst-case constant lookup time, O(1). 
 * The name derives from the behavior of some species of cuckoo, where 
 * the cuckoo chick pushes the other eggs or young out of the nest when 
 * it hatches in a variation of the behavior referred to as brood 
 * parasitism; analogously, inserting a new key into a cuckoo hashing 
 * table may push an older key to a different location in the table.
 *
 * Constructor:
 * CuckooHash( size ) - Where size is the initial bucket size 
 * of the hashmap
 *
 * Public Methods:
 * int size() - The number of elements, <key,value> pairs,
 * in the hashmap
 * void clear() - Empty the hashmap.
 * List<V> values() - Return a List of all values of type 'V' in 
 * the hashmap.
 * Set<K> keys() - Return a Set of all keys of type 'K" in
 * the hashmap.
 * void put(K,V) - Insert the <key,value> pair of types K and V.
 * V get(K) - Return the value of type V for the key
 * provided of type K.
 * boolean remove(K, V) - Remove <key, value> pair, return true 
 * if found and removed, else false.
 * String printTable() - Return a String representing a
 * concatenation of all <key,value> pairs.

    /**
     * Method put
     *
     * Adds a key-value pair to the table by means of cuckoo hashing. 
     * Each element can only be inserted into one of two bucket locations,
     * defined by the two separate hash functions, h1(key) or h2(key).
     * Each element's initial location will always be defined
     * by h1(key). If later it is kicked out of that bucket location by 
     * another element insertion, it will move back and forth between those
     * two hash locations (aka, bucket locations).
     *
     * On its initial invocation, this method places the passed <key,value>
     * element at its h1(key) bucket location. If an element is already located
     * at that bucket location, it will be kicked out and moved to its secondary
     * location in order to make room for this initially inserted element. The
     * secondary location is defined by the kicked out key's alternative hash
     * function (aka, either h1(key) or h2(key), whichever is the one that moves
     * to the alternate location).
     *
     * This process will continue in a loop as it moves kicked out 
     * elements to their alternate location (defined by h1(key) and h2(key))
     * until either:
     * (1) an empty bucket is found, or
     * (2) we reach 'n' iterations, where 'n' is the bucket capacity
     * of the hashmap (see HINT below on this method of cycle
     * detection, the bucket capacity is held in variable 'CAPACITY').
     *
     * If we reach 'n' shuffles of elements being kicked out and moved to their
     * secondary locations (leading to what appears to be a cycle), we will grow
     * the hashmap and rehash (via method rehash()). After the rehash, we will
     * need to re-invoke this method recursively, as we will have one element that
     * was kicked out after the 'n' iteration that still needs to be inserted. Note,
     * that it is possible when the bucket lists is small, that we may need to rehash
     * twice to break a cycle. Again, this is done automatically when calling this
     * method recursively.
     *
     * MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE HINTS:
     *
     * HINT 1: To make sure you pass the provided tests in main, follow this rule:
     * - Given a <key, value> via method's invocation, the bucket it
     * determined by hashing the 'key'
     * - Normally, we would not allow dupe keys, for our purposes here we
     * WILL allow. What will be unique in this assignment's implementation
     * is the <key,value> in the table. So when inserting a key that is
     * already in the table, continue unless a dupe key has the same
     * value as being inserted.
     *
     * The above is being done to make testing easy on causing cycles with minimal
     * insertions into the hash table.
     *
     * HINT 2: For simplicity of this assignment, after shuffling elements between
     * buckets 'n' times (where 'n' is defined by the value of variable 'CAPACITY',
     * you can assume you are in an infinite cycle. This may not be true, but if
     * growing the hash map when not in a cycle, this will not cause data integrity
     * issues. BUT BE CLEAR IN PRACTICE, as we discussed in class, a better way to
     * do this is to build a graph (one edge at a time) for each element shuffled
     * (and edge being defined as with end-points of the two bucket locations for the
     * moved element). This once a cycle is detected in this graph, which is by starting
     * to traverse an existing edge in the graph, we have a cycle. However, we have not
